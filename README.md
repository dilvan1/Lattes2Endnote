Lattes2Endnote
==============

The Lattes XML to EndNote tab format bibliographic references extractor and converter will extract all references to your publications in Lattes and convert them in EndNote tab format. This format can be read by many sites, including the [ResearcherID] (http://www.researcherid.com/) site, and transformed into other formats, like BibTex, by tools, such as the ones at the ResearchID site.

##Install

You will need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed in your computer. If you do not have one, install it free from the [Java site] (https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp).
Just download the executables:
* For Macs: Get the zip file [Lattes2Endnote.zip] (https://github.com/dilvan1/Lattes2Endnote/raw/master/Lattes2Endnote.zip) and unzip it.
* For Windows and Linux: Get the jar file [Lattes2Endnote.zip] (https://github.com/dilvan1/Lattes2Endnote/raw/master/Lattes2Endnote.jar) and click on it. This file works also in Macs.

##To run

Save the Lattes CV in XML (there is an icon on the top of the CV's web page) and run Lattes2Endnote. In the program UI's you can choose the Lattes CV XML file and a name for the EndNote file. The UI is simple and easy to use.
